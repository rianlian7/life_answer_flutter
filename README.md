My first project for learning flutter.

# Life Answers

The user will have to ask a "YES" or "NO" kind of questions such as:

- Will I get married one day?
- Will the world end tomorrow?
- Should I work for the government?
- Should I join football club?
- Should I buy an iPhone?

Then the app will answer in different yes and no answers.


P.S. - Basically a Magic 8 Ball game.
